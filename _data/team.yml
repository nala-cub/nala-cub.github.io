- name: Katharina von der Wense (neé Kann)
  description: I’m an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at CU Boulder and an Associate Professor of Artificial Intelligence at JGU Mainz. My work is focussed on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Research-wise, I am interested in multilingual NLP (how can we make NLP systems work for all of the world’s languages?), transfer learning (how can models use knowledge gained from a source task for a target task?), and computational morphology (how can models learn about and leverage subword information?). In my free time, I enjoy traveling, dancing, hiking, biking, and scuba diving, and I love sushi, ice cream and watermelons.

  description: After completing my undergrad at University of Toronto in computer engineering, I pursued my masters in computer science with a focus on natural language processing. While investigating new auxiliary tasks for BERT pre-training, I saw the power of modern language models while learning the inherent limitation of inhabiting purely textual environments. Co-advised by Alessandro Roncone and Katharina von der Wense, I am now working towards my PhD at CU Boulder to answer how robotics can help ground language in the real world and how language can help our interaction and collaboration with robots.
