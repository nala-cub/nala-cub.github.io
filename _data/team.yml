- name: Katharina von der Wense (neé Kann)
  description: I’m an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at CU Boulder, where I work on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Research-wise, I am interested in multilingual NLP (how can we make NLP systems work for all of the world’s languages?), transfer learning (how can models use knowledge gained from a source task for a target task?), and computational morphology (how can models learn about and leverage subword information?). More generally, circumstances permitting, I spend a lot of my time traveling, dancing, hiking, biking, and scuba diving, and I love sushi, ice cream and watermelons.

- name: Luke Gessler
  description: I am a postdoc with Prof. Katharina von der Wense in the computer science department. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in computational linguistics from Georgetown University. My major interest is in low-resource NLP, and my dissertation focused in particular on obtaining and evaluating low-resource word representations. I am especially interested in low-resource NLP as it relates to the language documentation, which is the process of recording a language's lexicon and grammar. I have also worked on lexical semantics, linguistically rich dataset development, and various structured prediction tasks. Outside of work, I love cooking East and South Asian food and brewing makgeolli, a traditional Korean drink made from rice.

  description: After completing my undergrad at University of Toronto in computer engineering, I pursued my masters in computer science with a focus on natural language processing. While investigating new auxiliary tasks for BERT pre-training, I saw the power of modern language models while learning the inherent limitation of inhabiting purely textual environments. Co-advised by Alessandro Roncone and Katharina von der Wense, I am now working towards my PhD at CU Boulder to answer how robotics can help ground language in the real world and how language can help our interaction and collaboration with robots.
