- name: Connor Cook
  description: I am a Master's student at CU Boulder. I spent some time in the AML Lab at Brigham Young University as an undergraduate (see https://github.com/byu-aml-lab), and spent my first year at CU Boulder as a research assistant in the D'Mello Lab (see https://www.colorado.edu/ics/research/dmello-lab). I have experience in a couple different areas of natural language processing, but dialog systems (also known as chatbots) have become my most recent area of interest.

- name: Pragna Mandadi
  description: Hi, I'm a second-year Masters in Computer Science Student. I'm interested in developing multilayered and multidimensional AI systems that focus on revolutionizing the way modern problems are solved. Currently I'm working on a question reformulation project to enhance the model's ability to perceive and understand context so that the model can answer questions derived from a paragraph or a comprehension more accurately. Prior to this I've had an industry experience of 2.5 years at Citicorp Services as an Application Developer. In my free time I enjoy watching TV shows and socializing with people.

- name: Shiran Dudy
  description: I am a postdoc in computer science at CU Boulder, where I focus on natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). I am participating in the institute for student-AI teaming project (iSAT) where we investigate how to integrate digital assistants into a classroom setting. I am also interested in finding ways to address diversity in natural language generation (NLG), addressing algorithmic biases, working towards continual learning models (particularly in NLP), and accessibility and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).
      Outside of work I like practicing yoga, hiking, reading, cooking, and also just hanging out with friends. :-)

  description: I'm a fourth-year undergraduate in computer science, with a minor in linguistics. I am mostly interested in the fields of NLP and computational linguistics, and their applications in increasing accessibility for disadvantaged communities. This last year I worked with the RISE IRT through the Discovery Learning Apprenticeship (DLA), where I learned how to use ArcGIS and RStudio to analyse the unique vulnerability and hazard exposure of incarceration facilities in the United States. Prior to university, I spent a gap year in Taipei to study Mandarin Chinese, and in my free time I enjoy trying to not lose my Chinese, reading, skiing, cooking, and any/all river activities.
