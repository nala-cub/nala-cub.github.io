- name: Connor Cook
  description: I am a Master's student at CU Boulder. I spent some time in the AML Lab at Brigham Young University as an undergraduate (see https://github.com/byu-aml-lab), and spent my first year at CU Boulder as a research assistant in the D'Mello Lab (see https://www.colorado.edu/ics/research/dmello-lab). I have experience in a couple different areas of natural language processing, but dialog systems (also known as chatbots) have become my most recent area of interest.

  description: Hi, I'm a second-year Masters in Computer Science Student. I'm interested in developing multilayered and multidimensional AI systems that focus on revolutionizing the way modern problems are solved. Currently I'm working on a question reformulation project to enhance the model's ability to perceive and understand context so that the model can answer questions derived from a paragraph or a comprehension more accurately. Prior to this I've had an industry experience of 2.5 years at Citicorp Services as an Application Developer. In my free time I enjoy watching TV shows and socializing with people.

  description: I am a postdoc in computer science at CU Boulder, where I focus on natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). I am participating in the institute for student-AI teaming project (iSAT) where we investigate how to integrate digital assistants into a classroom setting. I am also interested in finding ways to address diversity in natural language generation (NLG), addressing algorithmic biases, working towards continual learning models (particularly in NLP), and accessibility and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).
      Outside of work I like practicing yoga, hiking, reading, cooking, and also just hanging out with friends. :-)

  description: I'm a fourth-year undergraduate in computer science, with a minor in linguistics. I am mostly interested in the fields of NLP and computational linguistics, and their applications in increasing accessibility for disadvantaged communities. This last year I worked with the RISE IRT through the Discovery Learning Apprenticeship (DLA), where I learned how to use ArcGIS and RStudio to analyse the unique vulnerability and hazard exposure of incarceration facilities in the United States. Prior to university, I spent a gap year in Taipei to study Mandarin Chinese, and in my free time I enjoy trying to not lose my Chinese, reading, skiing, cooking, and any/all river activities.

  description: I am a postdoc with Prof. Katharina von der Wense in the computer science department. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in computational linguistics from Georgetown University. My major interest is in low-resource NLP, and my dissertation focused in particular on obtaining and evaluating low-resource word representations. I am especially interested in low-resource NLP as it relates to the language documentation, which is the process of recording a language's lexicon and grammar. I have also worked on lexical semantics, linguistically rich dataset development, and various structured prediction tasks. Outside of work, I love cooking East and South Asian food and brewing makgeolli, a traditional Korean drink made from rice.

  description: I am a computer science student at CU Boulder, I am currently in my third year of undergraduate studies pursuing a BAM (Bachelor’s Accelerated Master’s degree) in computer science. I recently joined this team as a part of the SPUR 2024 research. I am passionate about natural language processing and linguistics. Particularly, I am interested in how we can leverage our position as computer scientists to develop better language resources for documenting and educating so that we can preserve the snapshot of culture that endangered languages represent. This summer I will be working on an HCI research project on apps for endangered language documentation. In my free time I love to apply what I have learned in the classroom to build new projects, spend time with friends and family, or do anything outdoors.
